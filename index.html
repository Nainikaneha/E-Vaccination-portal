You may feel itching, tingling, burning or pain in a specific area of the body, typically on one side of the body or face, prior to the appearance of a blistering rash. For most people, the pain associated with the shingles rash usually lessens as it heals.<br><b>
                            How is it spread?:</b>
After you have the varicella (chickenpox) infection, the virus lies dormant for many years. It can become active again and present itself in the form of shingles. Shingles is an often debilitating and blistering rash that typically affects a side of your body or face. Some people experience severe long-term pain after the shingles rash has disappeared. These people also face other complications, including skin infections and scarring, which can interfere with normal day-to-day activities.

                             Varicella (chickenpox) is a viral disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus.
it include a slight fever, headaches, a runny nose, fluid-filled blisters, and a general ill feeling.<br><b>
                                How is it spread?:</b>
The virus is spread by direct contact with fluid in the lesions, or through airborne spread from the respiratory tract of an infected person.
<br><b>why it's serious?:</b>
Most infections, and most of the severe cases, occur in children under the age of 12 who are unvaccinated. However, the risk of severe varicella infection increases with age. Adults, particularly pregnant women, are at increased risk of severe disease. Children with impaired immunity are at risk of severe varicella and death.

                    <p><b>What it is?:</b>A  bactarial disease  causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration,usually spread in water.Cholera is fatal if not treated right away.
                        <br><b>How is it spread?:</b>The cholera bacteria is passed through feces(poop).It is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated by the feces of an infected person.This occurs more often in undeveloped countries lacking proper water supplies and sewage disposal.<br>
                        <b>Why it's serious?:</b>A bacterium called Vibrio cholerae causes cholera infection. The deadly effects of the disease are the result of a toxin the bacteria produces in the small intestine. The toxin causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to diarrhea and a rapid loss of fluids and salts (electrolytes).
